By: Joon Chang, Michael Doyle, Ramou Jallow, and Vincent Xu

## Description
This app takes two datasets from an experiment done by NOAA on various coral reef sites in the Caribbean area. The data focuses
on trying to mitigate the spread of white band disease on the coral reefs and this app compares two of the data sets from the experiment 
and analysizes the effectiveness of the various treatments for the disease as well as why the disease has been detered or not.

To run the app, load the correct libraries in, source the analysis files, and initialize the ui and server to run the shineyApp function.
